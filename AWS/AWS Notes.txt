IMPQ2. What is Cloud Computing?
	• Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage,applications, and other IT resources
	• Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
	• You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
	• You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
	• Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
	• Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.



Q3. The Deployment Models of the Cloud
	Private Cloud:
		• Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
		• Complete control
		• Security for sensitive applications
		• Meet specific business needs
		EG. ROCKSPACE
	Public Cloud:
		• Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
		• Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
		EG. Gogle Cloud, AWS
	Hybrid Cloud:
		• Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
		• Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
		• Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud


Q4. The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
	• On-demand self service:
		• Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
	• Broad network access:
		• Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
	• Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
		• Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
	• Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
		• Rapid elasticity and scalability:
	• Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
		• Quickly and easily scale based on demand
	• Measured service:
		• Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

Q5. Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
	• Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
		• Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
		• Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
	• Benefit from massive economies of scale
		• Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
	• Stop guessing capacity
		• Scale based on actual measured usage
	• Increase speed and agility
	• Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
	• Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Q6. Problems solved by the Cloud
	• Flexibility: change resource types when needed
	• Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
	• Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
	• Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
	• High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
	• Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications


Q7. Types of Cloud Computing
	• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		• Provide building blocks for cloud IT
		• Provides networking, computers, data storage space
		• Highest level of flexibility
		• Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
		• Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
		• GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
	• Platform as a Service (PaaS)
		• Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
		• Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
		• Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
		• Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
	• Software as a Service (SaaS)
		• Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
		• Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom
		• Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)

Q8. Pricing of the Cloud – Quick Overview
	• AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing
	model
	• Compute:
		• Pay for compute time
	• Storage:
		• Pay for data stored in the Cloud
	• Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
		• Data transfer IN is free
	• Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

Q9. AWS Cloud Use Cases
	• AWS enables you to build sophisticated, scalable applications
	• Applicable to a diverse set of industries
	• Use cases include
		• Enterprise IT, Backup & Storage, Big Data analytics
		• Website hosting, Mobile & Social Apps
		• Gaming	


Q10. AWS Global Infrastructure
	• AWS Regions
		• AWS has Regions all around the world
		• Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3…
		• A region is a cluster of data centers
		• Most AWS services are region-scoped
		How to choose an AWS Region?
			• Compliance with data governance and legal
			requirements: data never leaves a region without
			your explicit permission
			• Proximity to customers: reduced latency
			• Available services within a Region: new services
			and new features aren’t available in every Region
			• Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is
			transparent in the service pricing page
			If you need to launch a new application,
			where should you do it?
	• AWS Availability Zones
		Each region has many availability zones
		(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
		• ap-southeast-2a
		• ap-southeast-2b
		• ap-southeast-2c
		• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more
		discrete data centers with redundant power,
		networking, and connectivity
		• They’re separate from each other, so that
		they’re isolated from disasters
		• They’re connected with high bandwidth,
		ultra-low latency networking
		AWS Region
		Sydney: ap-southeast-2
		ap-southeast-2a
		ap-southeast-2b ap-southeast-2c
	• AWS Data Centers
	• AWS Edge Locations
		Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations & 10+
		Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
		• Content is delivered to end users with lower latency



Q11. Tour of the AWS Console
	• AWS has Global Services:
		• Identity and Access Management (IAM)
		• Route 53 (DNS service)
		• CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
		• WAF (Web Application Firewall)
	• Most AWS services are Region-scoped:
		• Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)
		• Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service)
		• Lambda (Function as a Service)
		• Rekognition (Software as a Service)

Q14. IAM: Users & Groups
	• IAM = Identity and Access Management, Global service
	• Root account created by default, shouldn’t be used or shared
	• Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped
	• Groups only contain users, not other groups
	• Users don’t have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups


Q15. IAM: Permissions
	• Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies
	• These policies define the permissions of the users
	• In AWS you apply the least privilege principle: don’t give more permissions than a user needs

{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
					{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "ec2:Describe*",
					"Resource": "*"
					},
					{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
					"Resource": "*"
					},
					{
					"Effect": "Allow",
					"Action": [
					"cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
					"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
					"cloudwatch:Describe*"
					],
					"Resource": "*"
					}
					]
		}	



Q16. IAM Policies Structure
	• Consists of
	• Version: policy language version, always include “2012-10-
	17”
	• Id: an identifier for the policy (optional)
	• Statement: one or more individual statements (required)
	• Statements consists of
	• Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional)
	• Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access
	(Allow, Deny)
	• Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to
	• Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies
	• Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to
	• Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect
	(optional)


Q17. IAM – Password Policy
	• Strong passwords = higher security for your account
	• In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
	• Set a minimum password length
	• Require specific character types:
	• including uppercase letters
	• lowercase letters
	• numbers
	• non-alphanumeric characters
	• Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
	• Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
	• Prevent password re-use

Q18. Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
	• Users have access to your account and can possibly change
	configurations or delete resources in your AWS account
	• You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
	• MFA = password you know + security device you own
	• Main benefit of MFA:
	if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised


		MFA devices options in AWS
		Virtual MFA device
		Google Authenticator
		(phone only)
		Authy
		(multi-device)
		Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key
		YubiKey by Yubico (3rd party)
		Support for multiple tokens on a single device. Support for multiple root and IAM users
		using a single security key

		MFA devices options in AWS
		Hardware Key Fob MFA Device
		Provided by Gemalto (3rd party)
		Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for
		AWS GovCloud (US)
		Provided by SurePassID (3rd party)



Q19. How can users access AWS ?
	• To access AWS, you have three options:
		• AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA)
		• AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): protected by access keys
		• AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys
	• Access Keys are generated through the AWS Console
	• Users manage their own access keys
	• Access Keys are secret, just like a password. Don’t share them
	• Access Key ID ~= username
	• Secret Access Key ~= password

Q20. What’s the AWS CLI?
	• A tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in 	your command-line shell
	• Direct access to the public APIs of AWS services
	• You can develop scripts to manage your resources
	• It’s open-source https://github.com/aws/aws-cli
	• Alternative to using AWS Management Console

Q21. What’s the AWS SDK?
	• AWS Software Development Kit (AWS SDK)
	• Language-specific APIs (set of libraries)
	• Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically
	• Embedded within your application
	• Supports
		• SDKs (JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js,C++)
		• Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS, …)
		• IoT Device SDKs (Embedded C, Arduino, …)
	• Example: AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Python

Q22. IAM Roles for Services
	• Some AWS service will need to perform actions on your behalf
	• To do so, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM Roles
	• Common roles:
		• EC2 Instance Roles
		• Lambda Function Roles
		• Roles for CloudFormation

Q23. IAM Security Tools
	• IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
		• a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
	• IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
		• Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed.
		• You can use this information to revise your policies.

Q24. IAM Guidelines & Best Practices
	• Don’t use the root account except for AWS account setup
	• One physical user = One AWS user
	• Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
	• Create a strong password policy
	• Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
	• Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
	• Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
	• Audit permissions of your account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access Advisor
	• Never share IAM users & Access Keys		

Q25. Shared Responsibility Model 
	IAM
		• Infrastructure (global network security)
		• Configuration and	vulnerability analysis
		• Compliance validation
	You
		• Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring
		• Enable MFA on all accounts
		• Rotate all your keys often
		• Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions
		• Analyze access patterns & review permissions	

Q26. IAM Section – Summary
	• Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console
	• Groups: contains users only
	• Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users or groups
	• Roles: for EC2 instances or AWS services
	• Security: MFA + Password Policy

Q27. Amazon EC2
	• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering
	• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
	• It mainly consists in the capability of :
	• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
	• Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

Q28. EC2 sizing & configuration options
	• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
	• How much compute power & cores (CPU)
	• How much random-access memory (RAM)
	• How much storage space:
	• Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
	• hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
	• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
	• Firewall rules: security group
	• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data


Q29. EC2 User Data
	• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
	• bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
	• That script is only run once at the instance first start
	• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
	• Installing updates
	• Installing software
	• Downloading common files from the internet
	• Anything you can think of
	• The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user


Q30. EC2 Instance Types - Overview
	• You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for
	different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
	• AWS has the following naming convention:
	m5.2xlarge
	• m: instance class
	• 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
	• 2xlarge: size within the instance class

Q31. t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)
	Great

Q32. Introduction to Security Groups
	• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
	• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
	• Security groups only contain rules
	• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group	

Q33. Security Groups
	Deeper Dive
	• Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
	• They regulate:
	• Access to Ports
	• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
	• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
	• Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Q34. Security Groups
	Good to know
	• Can be attached to multiple instances
	• Locked down to a region / VPC combination
	• Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
	• It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
	• If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
	• If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application
	error or it’s not launched
	• All inbound traffic is blocked by default
	• All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Q35. Classic Ports to know
	• 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
	• 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
	• 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
	• 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
	• 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
	• 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

Q36. EC2 Instances Purchasing Options
	• On-Demand Instances – short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second
	• Reserved (1 & 3 years)
	• Reserved Instances – long workloads
	• Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances
	• Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) –commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
	• Spot Instances – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
	• Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement
	• Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware
	• Capacity Reservations – reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

Q37. EC2 On Demand
	• Pay for what you use:
	• Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute
	• All other operating systems - billing per hour
	• Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
	• No long-term commitment
	• Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where
	you can't predict how the application will behave

Q38. EC2 Reserved Instances
	• Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
	• You reserve a specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
	• Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
	• Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
	• Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
	• Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
	• You can buy and sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
	• Convertible Reserved Instance
	• Can change the EC2 instance type, instance family, OS, scope and tenancy
	• Up to 66% discount Note: the % discounts are different from the video as AWS
	change them over time – the exact numbers are not needed
	for the exam. This is just for illustrative purposes J



Q39. EC2 Savings Plans
	• Get a discount based on long-term usage (up to 72% - same as RIs)
	• Commit to a certain type of usage ($10/hour for 1 or 3 years)
	• Usage beyond EC2 Savings Plans is billed at the On-Demand price
	• Locked to a specific instance family & AWS region (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
	• Flexible across:
	• Instance Size (e.g., m5.xlarge, m5.2xlarge)
	• OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
	• Tenancy (Host, Dedicated, Default)

Q40. EC2 Spot Instances
	• Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
	• Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the
	current spot price
	• The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
	• Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
	• Batch jobs
	• Data analysis
	• Image processing
	• Any distributed workloads
	• Workloads with a flexible start and end time
	• Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

Q41. EC2 Dedicated Hosts
	• A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use
	• Allows you address compliance requirements and use your existing serverbound
	software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe—VM software licenses)
	• Purchasing Options:
	• On-demand – pay per second for active Dedicated Host
	• Reserved - 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)
	• The most expensive option
	• Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL – Bring Your
	Own License)
	• Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

Q42. EC2 Dedicated Instances
	• Instances run on hardware that’s
	dedicated to you
	• May share hardware with other
	instances in same account
	• No control over instance placement
	(can move hardware after Stop / Start)

Q43. EC2 Capacity Reservations
	• Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any
	duration
	• You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it
	• No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts
	• Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit
	from billing discounts
	• You’re charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not
	• Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a
	specific AZ

Q44. Which purchasing option is right for me?
	• On demand: coming and staying in resort
	whenever we like, we pay the full price
	• Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to
	stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
	• Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for
	certain period and stay in any room type (e.g.,
	King, Suite, Sea View, …)
	• Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for
	the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the
	rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
	• Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of
	the resort
	• Capacity Reservations: you book a room for a
	period with full price even you don’t stay in it

Q45. Shared Responsibility Model for EC2
	aws
	• Infrastructure (global
	network security)
	• Isolation on physical hosts
	• Replacing faulty hardware
