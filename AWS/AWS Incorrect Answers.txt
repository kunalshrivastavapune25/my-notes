The organization also wants to connect its on-premises data center with the different virtual private clouds (VPC) for better organization-wide collaboration. Which AWS services can be combined to build the MOST efficient solution for this use-case? (Select two)






Explanation
Correct option:

AWS Transit Gateway

AWS Transit Gateway connects virtual private clouds (VPC) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as a cloud router – each new connection is only made once. As you expand globally, inter-Region peering connects AWS Transit Gateways using the AWS global network. Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.

How AWS Transit Gateway can simplify your network:  via - https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/

AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than Internet-based connections.

Incorrect options:

VPC peering connection - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. VPC peering connection is not transitive, a separate VPC peering connection has to be made between two VPCs that need to talk to each other. With a growing number of virtual private clouds (VPC), this gets difficult to manage.

Transitive VPC peering connection is not allowed:  via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/invalid-peering-configurations.html

Internet Gateway - An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. You cannot use the internet gateway to connect your on-premises data center with multiple VPCs within your AWS network.

AWS Storage Gateway - AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. All data transferred between the gateway and AWS storage is encrypted using SSL (for all three types of gateways - File, Volume and Tape Gateways). You cannot use AWS Storage Gateway to connect your on-premises data center with multiple VPCs within your AWS network.

Question 32:
A financial services company wants to migrate from its on-premises data center to AWS Cloud. As a Cloud Practitioner, which AWS service would you recommend so that the company can compare the cost of running their IT infrastructure on-premises vs AWS Cloud?





Explanation
Correct option:

AWS Pricing Calculator

AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out setting up a new set of instances and services. AWS Pricing Calculator can be accessed at https://calculator.aws/#/.

AWS also offers a complimentary service called Migration Evaluator (Formerly TSO Logic) to create data-driven business cases for AWS Cloud planning and migration.

Incorrect options:

AWS Trusted Advisor - AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks. These checks identify ways to optimize your AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service quotas. This service cannot be used to compare the cost of running the IT infrastructure on-premises vs AWS Cloud.

AWS Cost Explorer - AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time. AWS Cost Explorer includes a default report that helps you visualize the costs and usage associated with your top five cost-accruing AWS services, and gives you a detailed breakdown of all services in the table view. The reports let you adjust the time range to view historical data going back up to twelve months to gain an understanding of your cost trends. AWS Cost Explorer cannot be used to compare the cost of running the IT infrastructure on-premises vs AWS Cloud.

AWS Budgets - AWS Budgets gives the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Budgets can be created at the monthly, quarterly, or yearly level, and you can customize the start and end dates. You can further refine your budget to track costs associated with multiple dimensions, such as AWS service, linked account, tag, and others. AWS Budgets cannot be used to compare the cost of running the IT infrastructure on-premises vs AWS Cloud.

Question 33:
Which of the following AWS Support plans provide programmatic access to AWS Support Center features to create, manage and close your support cases? (Select two)






Explanation
Correct options:

AWS offers four different support plans to cater to each of its customers - AWS Developer Support, AWS Business Support, AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support and AWS Enterprise Support plans. A basic support plan is included for all AWS customers.

AWS Enterprise Support

You should use the AWS Enterprise Support plan to provide customers with concierge-like service where the main focus is helping the customer achieve their outcomes and find success in the cloud. With AWS Enterprise Support plan, you get 24x7 technical support from high-quality engineers, tools and technology to automatically manage the health of your environment, consultative architectural guidance delivered in the context of your applications and use-cases, and a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) to coordinate access to proactive/preventative programs and AWS subject matter experts. AWS Enterprise Support plan provides 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support however it's costlier than the AWS Business Support plan. You get programmatic access (API Access) to AWS Support Center features to create, manage, and close your support cases, and operationally manage your Trusted Advisor check requests and status. You should note that the AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support plan also gets programmatic access (API Access) to AWS Support Center.

AWS Business Support

You should use the AWS Business Support plan if you have production workloads on AWS and want 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support and architectural guidance in the context of your specific use-cases. You get programmatic access (API Access) to AWS Support Center features to create, manage, and close your support cases, and operationally manage your Trusted Advisor check requests and status.

Exam Alert:

Please review the differences between the AWS Developer Support, AWS Business Support, AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support and AWS Enterprise Support plans as you can expect at least a couple of questions on the exam:







via - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/

Incorrect options:

AWS Basic Support - AWS Basic Support plan only provides access to the following:

Customer Service & Communities - 24x7 access to customer service, documentation, whitepapers, and support forums. AWS Trusted Advisor - Access to the core Trusted Advisor checks and guidance to provision your resources following best practices to increase performance and improve security. AWS Health Dashboard – Your account health : A personalized view of the health of AWS services, and alerts when your resources are impacted.

AWS Developer Support - You should use the AWS Developer Support plan if you are testing or doing early development on AWS and want the ability to get email based technical support during business hours as well as general architectural guidance as you build and test.

Both these plans do not support programmatic access (API Access) to AWS Support Center.

AWS Corporate Support - This is a made-up option and has been added as a distractor.

Question 35:
As per the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following is a responsibility of AWS from a security and compliance point of view?





Explanation
Correct option:

Patching networking infrastructure

According to the AWS Shared Responsibility Model, AWS is responsible for "Security of the Cloud". This includes protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services. Therefore, patching networking infrastructure is the responsibility of AWS.

Incorrect options:

Service and Communications Protection

Identity and Access Management

Patching guest OS and applications

The customer is responsible for security "in" the cloud. This covers things such as services and communications protection; Identity and Access Management; and patching guest OS and applications. Customers are responsible for managing their data including encryption options and using Identity and Access Management tools for implementing appropriate access control policies as per their organization requirements. Therefore, these three options fall under the responsibility of the customer according to the AWS shared responsibility model.

Exam Alert:

Please review the AWS Shared Responsibility Model in detail as you can expect multiple questions on this topic in the exam:  via - https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/

Reference:

Question 36:
Bob and Susan each have an AWS account in AWS Organizations. Susan has five Reserved Instances (RIs) of the same type and Bob has none. During one particular hour, Susan uses three instances and Bob uses six for a total of nine instances on the organization's consolidated bill.

Which of the following statements are correct about consolidated billing in AWS Organizations? (Select two)






Explanation
Correct options:

Bob receives the cost-benefit from Susan's Reserved Instances (RI) only if he launches his instances in the same Availability Zone (AZ) where Susan purchased her Reserved Instances

Bob receives the cost-benefit from Susan's Reserved Instances (RI) only if he launches his instances in the same Availability Zone (AZ) where Susan purchased her Reserved Instances. For example, if Susan specifies us-west-2a when she purchases her Reserved Instances, Bob must specify us-west-2a when he launches his instances to get the cost-benefit on the organization's consolidated bill. However, the actual locations of Availability Zones (AZs) are independent of one account to another. For example, the us-west-2a Availability Zone (AZ) for Bob's account might be in a different location than the location for Susan's account.

AWS bills five instances as Reserved Instances, and the remaining four instances as regular instances

Since Susan has five Reserved Instances (RIs), AWS bills five instances as Reserved Instances, and the remaining four instances as regular instances.

Incorrect options:

AWS bills three instances as Reserved Instances (RI), and the remaining six instances as regular instances - This option contradicts the explanation provided above, so it's incorrect.

Bob does not receive any cost-benefit since he hasn't purchased any Reserved Instance (RI). If his account has even one RI, then the cost-benefit from Susan's account is also added to his account - For billing purposes, the consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations treats all the accounts in the organization as one account. This means that all accounts in the organization can receive the hourly cost-benefit of Reserved Instance (RI) that are purchased by any other account.

Bob receives the cost-benefit from Susan's Reserved Instance (RI) only if he launches his instances in the same AWS Region where Susan purchased her Reserved Instances (RI) - As discussed above, this statement is incorrect. Bob receives the cost-benefit from Susan's Reserved Instances only if he launches his instances in the same Availability Zone (AZ) where Susan purchased her Reserved Instance (RI).

Question 37:
A cargo shipping company runs its server fleet on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Some of these instances host the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) applications that need to be accessible 24*7. These applications are not mission-critical. In case of a disaster, these applications can be managed on a lesser number of instances for some time.

Which disaster recovery strategy is well-suited as well as cost-effective for this requirement?





Explanation
Correct option:

Warm Standby strategy

When selecting your disaster recovery (DR) strategy, you must weigh the benefits of lower RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective) vs the costs of implementing and operating a strategy. The pilot light and warm standby strategies both offer a good balance of benefits and cost.

This strategy replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables. These data resources are ready to serve requests. In addition to replication, this strategy requires you to create a continuous backup in the recovery Region. This is because when "human action" type disasters occur, data can be deleted or corrupted, and replication will replicate the bad data. Backups are necessary to enable you to get back to the last known good state.

The warm standby strategy deploys a functional stack, but at reduced capacity. The DR endpoint can handle requests, but cannot handle production levels of traffic. It may be more, but is always less than the full production deployment for cost savings. If the passive stack is deployed to the recovery Region at full capacity, however, then this strategy is known as “hot standby.” Because warm standby deploys a functional stack to the recovery Region, this makes it easier to test Region readiness using synthetic transactions.

Disaster recovery (DR) strategies:  via - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/disaster-recovery-dr-architecture-on-aws-part-iii-pilot-light-and-warm-standby/

Incorrect options:

Multi-site active-active strategy - This strategy uses AWS Regions as your active sites, creating a multi-Region active/active architecture. Generally, two Regions are used. Each Region hosts a highly available, multi-Availability Zone (AZ) workload stack. In each Region, data is replicated live between the data stores and also backed up. This protects against disasters that include data deletion or corruption since the data backup can be restored to the last known good state. Each regional stack serves production traffic effectively. But, this strategy is cost involving and should only be used for mission-critical applications.

Pilot Light strategy - Pilot Light, like Warm Standby strategy, replicates data from the primary Region to data resources in the recovery Region, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instances or Amazon DynamoDB tables. But, the DR Region in a pilot light strategy (unlike warm standby) cannot serve requests until additional steps are taken. A pilot light in a home furnace does not provide heat to the home. It provides a quick way to light the furnace burners that then provide heat.

Warm standby can handle traffic at reduced levels immediately. Pilot light requires you to first deploy infrastructure and then scale out resources before the workload can handle requests.

Backup & Restore strategy - Backup and Restore is associated with higher RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective). This results in longer downtimes and greater loss of data between when the disaster event occurs and recovery. However, backup and restore can still be the right strategy for workloads because it is the easiest and least expensive strategy to implement.

Question 44:
Reserved Instance (RI) pricing is available for which of the following AWS services? (Select two)






Explanation
Correct options:

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)

A Reserved Instance (RI) is a reservation that provides a discounted hourly rate in exchange for an upfront fee and term contract. Services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) use this approach to sell reserved capacity for hourly use of Reserved Instances (RI). It is not a virtual machine. It is a commitment to pay in advance for specific Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS instances.

Incorrect options:

Amazon CloudFront - Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service. Amazon CloudFront does not offer "Reserved Capacity" pricing.

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) - Amazon S3 infrastructure is managed by AWS. So, Reserved Instance (RI) does not make sense here. But, Amazon S3 offers volume discounts for its storage classes.

AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) - AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM), you can create and manage IAM users and IAM user groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. This is a free service to every AWS customer.

Question 45:
Which AWS service can help you analyze your infrastructure to identify unattached or underutilized Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes?





Explanation
Correct option:

AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides real-time guidance to help provision your resources following AWS best practices. Whether establishing new workflows, developing applications, or as part of ongoing improvement, recommendations provided by Trusted Advisor regularly help keep your solutions provisioned optimally. AWS Trusted Advisor analyzes your AWS environment and provides best practice recommendations in five categories: Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, Service Limits.

AWS Trusted Advisor can check Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume configurations and warns when volumes appear to be underused. Charges begin when a volume is created. If a volume remains unattached or has very low write activity (excluding boot volumes) for a period of time, the volume is probably not being used.

How AWS Trusted Advisor Works:  via - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/

Incorrect options:

AWS Config - AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. Think resource-specific change history, audit, and compliance; think Config. Its a configuration tracking service and not an infrastructure tracking service.

Amazon CloudWatch - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch provides data and actionable insights to monitor applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. Amazon EBS emits notifications based on Amazon CloudWatch Events for a variety of volume, snapshot, and encryption status changes. With CloudWatch Events, you can establish rules that trigger programmatic actions in response to a change in volume, snapshot, or encryption key state (though not for underutilized volume usage).

Amazon Inspector - Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices. Its a security assessment service and not an infrastructure tracking service.

Question 51:
A firm wants to maintain the same data on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) between its production account and multiple test accounts. Which technique should you choose to copy data into multiple test accounts while retaining object metadata?





Explanation
Correct option:

Amazon S3 Replication

Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can copy objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region. You can use replication to make copies of your objects that retain all metadata, such as the original object creation time and version IDs. This capability is important if you need to ensure that your replica is identical to the source object.

Exam Alert:

Amazon S3 supports two types of replication: S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR) vs S3 same-region replication (S3 SRR). Please review the differences between S3 SRR and S3 CRR:  via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/replication.html

Incorrect options:

Amazon S3 Bucket Policy - A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You add a bucket policy to a bucket to grant other AWS accounts or IAM users access permissions for the bucket and the objects in it. Object permissions apply only to the objects that the bucket owner creates. You cannot replicate data using a bucket policy.

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. This facility speeds up access between end-user and S3, this is not for replicating data.

Amazon S3 Storage Classes - Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. Each storage class has a defined set of rules to store, encrypt data at a certain price. Based on the use case, customers can choose the storage class that best suits their business requirements.

These include S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data; S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns; S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data; and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation. You cannot replicate data using storage classes.

How to enable the U2F Security Key for your own IAM user:  via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_u2f.html

Incorrect options:

Virtual Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) device - This is a software app that runs on a phone or other device and emulates a physical device. The device generates a six-digit numeric code based upon a time-synchronized one-time password algorithm. The user must type a valid code from the device on a second webpage during sign-in. Each virtual MFA device assigned to a user must be unique.

Hardware Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) device - This is a hardware device that generates a six-digit numeric code based upon a time-synchronized one-time password algorithm. The user must type a valid code from the device on a second webpage during sign-in. Each MFA device assigned to a user must be unique. A user cannot type a code from another user's device to be authenticated.

SMS text message-based Multi-Factor Authentication (AWS MFA) - This is a type of MFA in which the IAM user settings include the phone number of the user's SMS-compatible mobile device. When the user signs in, AWS sends a six-digit numeric code by SMS text message to the user's mobile device. The user is required to type that code on a second webpage during sign-in.
