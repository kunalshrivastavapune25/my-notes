Amazon Web Services (AWS) Overview:
What is AWS?
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing plform provided by Amazon.
It offers a wide range of cloud services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more.
AWS Services:

	Compute Services:
		Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers in the cloud.
		AWS Lambda: Serverless computing.

	Storage Services:
		Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage.
		Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store): Block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.

	Database Services:
		Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational databases.
		Amazon DynamoDB: Fully managed NoSQL database service.

	Networking Services:
		Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Networking for AWS resources.
		Amazon Route 53: Domain Name System (DNS) web service.

	Machine Learning and AI Services:
		Amazon SageMaker: Build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
		Amazon Comprehend: Natural language processing.

	Management and Monitoring:
		AWS CloudWatch: Monitoring and management service.
		AWS CloudTrail: Auditing and monitoring for AWS accounts.

	Security Services:
		AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): User and access management.
		AWS Key Management Service (KMS): Managed encryption keys.

	AWS Global Infrastructure:
		AWS operates in multiple regions and availability zones globally.
		Regions are geographic areas, and availability zones are data centers within those regions.
		Billing and Pricing:

	AWS offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
		Pricing varies based on the services used, region, and usage patterns.


IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three different categories of cloud computing services that provide varying levels of abstraction and management responsibility for users.

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):

Definition: IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It offers virtual machines, storage, and networking, allowing users to run applications and manage their own operating systems.
Example (AWS): Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service).
PaaS (Platform as a Service):

Definition: PaaS delivers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexities of infrastructure. It typically includes a runtime, development tools, and services for application hosting.
Example (AWS): AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Google App Engine.
SaaS (Software as a Service):

Definition: SaaS provides ready-to-use software applications over the internet. Users can access and use the software without worrying about underlying infrastructure, maintenance, or updates.
Example (AWS): Amazon Chime, Salesforce, Google Workspace.
In summary:

IaaS: Infrastructure is provided, and users manage applications, data, runtime, middleware, and operating systems.
PaaS: Platform and tools are provided to build, deploy, and manage applications, and users manage the applications and data.
SaaS: Fully functional software applications are provided, and users only need to use the application without managing any underlying infrastructure or components.
FaaS stands for "Function as a Service." It is a category of cloud computing services that allows developers to execute individual functions or pieces of code in response to specific events without managing the underlying infrastructure. FaaS is a serverless computing model where developers can focus on writing code in the form of functions without dealing with the complexities of server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.


Q3. The Deployment Models of the Cloud
	Private Cloud:
		• Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public.
		• Complete control
		• Security for sensitive applications
		• Meet specific business needs
		EG. ROCKSPACE
	Public Cloud:
		• Cloud resources owned and operated by a thirdparty cloud service provider delivered over the Internet.
		• Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
		EG. Gogle Cloud, AWS
	Hybrid Cloud:
		• Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
		• Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
		• Flexibility and costeffectiveness of the public cloud


Q7. Types of Cloud Computing
	• Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		• Provide building blocks for cloud IT
		• Provides networking, computers, data storage space
		• Highest level of flexibility
		• Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
		• Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
		• GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
	• Platform as a Service (PaaS)
		• Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
		• Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
		• Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)
		• Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)
	• Software as a Service (SaaS)
		• Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
		• Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom
		• Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)

Q8. Pricing of the Cloud – Quick Overview
	• AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing
	model
	• Compute:
		• Pay for compute time
	• Storage:
		• Pay for data stored in the Cloud
	• Data transfer OUT of the Cloud:
		• Data transfer IN is free
	• Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT

Q10. AWS Global Infrastructure
	• AWS Regions
		• AWS has Regions all around the world
		• Names can be us-east-1, eu-west-3…
		• A region is a cluster of data centers
		• Most AWS services are region-scoped
		How to choose an AWS Region?
			• Compliance with data governance and legal
			requirements: data never leaves a region without
			your explicit permission
			• Proximity to customers: reduced latency
			• Available services within a Region: new services
			and new features aren’t available in every Region
			• Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is
			transparent in the service pricing page
			If you need to launch a new application,
			where should you do it?
	• AWS Availability Zones
		Each region has many availability zones
		(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6). Example:
		• ap-southeast-2a
		• ap-southeast-2b
		• ap-southeast-2c
		• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more
		discrete data centers with redundant power,
		networking, and connectivity
		• They’re separate from each other, so that
		they’re isolated from disasters
		• They’re connected with high bandwidth,
		ultra-low latency networking
		AWS Region
		Sydney: ap-southeast-2
		ap-southeast-2a
		ap-southeast-2b ap-southeast-2c
	• AWS Data Centers
	• AWS Edge Locations
		Amazon has 400+ Points of Presence (400+ Edge Locations & 10+
		Regional Caches) in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
		• Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
