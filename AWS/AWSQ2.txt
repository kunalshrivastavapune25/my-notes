	
1. Which of the following is an INCORRECT statement about Scaling, a design principle of Reliability pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
	 Fault tolerance is achieved by Horizontal scaling
	 Horizontal Scaling implies you scale by adding more instances to your existing pool of resources
	 Vertical Scaling implies you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to your existing machine/node
	 Fault tolerance is achieved by Vertical Scaling
Correct option:
Fault tolerance is achieved by Vertical Scaling
A “vertically scalable” system, is constrained to be running its processes on only one computer. In such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory or storage. Fault tolerance is not possible on vertically scalable systems since a single instance is prone to failure.

DynamoDB
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints.
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses.
A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services are supported:
Amazon S3
DynamoDB
Exam Alert:
You may see a question around this concept in the exam. Just remember that only S3 and DynamoDB support VPC Endpoint Gateway. All other services that support VPC Endpoints use a VPC Endpoint Interface.

55. Question
Which AWS Route 53 routing policy would you use to improve the performance for your customers by routing the requests to the AWS endpoint that provides the fastest experience?

 Latency routing policy
 Weighted routing policy
 Simple routing policy
 Failover routing policy
Unattempted
Correct option:
Latency routing policy
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like http://www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.
If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can use latency routing policy to improve the performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency. To use latency-based routing, you create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions. When Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain (example.com or acme.example.com), it determines which AWS Regions you’ve created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record, such as the IP address for a web server.
